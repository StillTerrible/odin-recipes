    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These chicken bacon ranch rolls are savory, salty, crunchy, and creamy.</p> 
    <p>Dunking them into ranch dressing results in an awesome cool tangy bite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 eggroll wrappers</li>
        <li>12 crispy chicken strips (such as TysonÂ® Crispy Chicken Strips) or 12 cooked chicken fingers, cooked and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>12 strips bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing for serving, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay an eggroll wrappers onto a work surface and divide chicken among the center of each wrapper.  Top each with 2 tablespoons cheese and crumble a slice of bacon over cheese on each wrapper.  Using a brush or finger, run a light layer of water around the edges of the wrapper, and fold the bottom corner slightly  over the filling.  Fold in the sides and then roll up the wrapper, making sure the roll is completely sealed.  Repeat with the remaining filled wrappers. </li>
        <li>Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry 2 to 3 rolls at a time, turning occasionally until golden brown and crisp.  Drain on paper towels and let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving with ranch dressing. </li>
    </ol>
